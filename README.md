# Sodoku-Brute
Brute force Sudoku puzzle solver

Written by Cameron Maberto

A program that solves Sodoku puzzles recursively.

SodokuBrutePythonPrototype was the original proof-of-concept prototype.
Prototype solves a hardcoded game board and was written to prove the logic and feasability of a recursive Sodoku puzzle solver.
Prototype shows the orgiginal board, solved board, and the amount of time it took to solve the puzzle in seconds.

SodokBruteJavaConsole is the translation of SodokuBrutePythonPrototype into Java.
The Java version adds its own data structures for easy translation from Python into Java.
The Java console also uses a hardcoded game board, displays the original board, solved board, amount of time to solve in ms, and
the number of recursive calls that were made during solving.
